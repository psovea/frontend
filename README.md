## Contributing

#### Adding a feature
Each branch should be related to an issue, and must conform to the following format: `issue/<issue-numer>-<description>`. We use React as our main framework. When adding a component, it should be added to `src/components`.

#### Starting the development server
Assuming that nodejs and npm are installed, a webpack dev server with hot reloading can be installed with the following commands:

```bash
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### Coding style

Code should conform to the following things:

- 4 spaces for indents
- no `;`s
